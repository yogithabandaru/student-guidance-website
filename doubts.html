<h2>📌 Academic & First-Year Doubts</h2>

<p class="question">Q1. I am from a non-CS background. Can I survive in IT?</p>
<p class="answer">
Yes. Many successful IT professionals started with zero coding knowledge.
First year is meant for building basics, not judging intelligence.
Consistency matters more than background.
</p>

<p class="question">Q2. Is first year very important?</p>
<p class="answer">
Yes. First year builds your foundation in programming, logic, and discipline.
Bad habits formed now affect later years.
</p>

<p class="question">Q3. Do marks matter more or skills?</p>
<p class="answer">
Both matter. Marks help in shortlisting; skills help in cracking interviews.
A balance is ideal.
</p>

<div class="card">
<h2>💻 Coding & Skill Doubts</h2>

<p class="question">Q4. Which programming language should I start with?</p>
<p class="answer">
Start with C or Python. Do not jump between languages.
Strong basics in one language are enough.
</p>

<p class="question">Q5. How many hours should I practice coding daily?</p>
<p class="answer">
1 hour daily is sufficient if done consistently.
Quality practice is more important than long hours.
</p>

<p class="question">Q6. Is it okay if I don’t understand code immediately?</p>
<p class="answer">
Yes. Confusion is part of learning.
Understanding improves with repetition and practice.
</p>

</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>🎓 Career & Placement Doubts</h2>

<p class="question">Q7. When should I start thinking about placements?</p>
<p class="answer">
From first year itself. Not preparation, but awareness and skill building.
</p>

<p class="question">Q8. Do companies expect perfection?</p>
<p class="answer">
No. Companies expect problem-solving ability and learning attitude.
</p>

<p class="question">Q9. Are projects compulsory for placements?</p>
<p class="answer">
Yes. Projects show practical knowledge and initiative.
Even small projects matter.
</p>

</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>🤖 AI & Technology Doubts</h2>

<p class="question">Q10. Will AI replace engineers?</p>
<p class="answer">
No. AI replaces tasks, not thinking engineers.
Engineers who use AI wisely will grow faster.
</p>

<p class="question">Q11. Should I depend completely on AI tools?</p>
<p class="answer">
No. AI is a support tool.
Fundamentals must come from your own learning.
</p>

</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>🧘 Mental Health & Confidence Doubts</h2>

<p class="question">Q12. I feel slow compared to others. What should I do?</p>
<p class="answer">
Everyone learns at a different pace.
Focus on progress, not comparison.
</p>

<p class="question">Q13. Is stress common in engineering?</p>
<p class="answer">
Yes. Proper time management and breaks reduce stress.
</p>
